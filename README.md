# Sparrow

Single Page Application Real-time Relational Object Wrapper.

It doesn't have to be used for a SPA, but it has JSON support out of the box to send objects inside messages (I personally prefer websockets).

Other words I could have used:
  
  - Postgres as database (and uses momoko to do it asynchronous)
  - Tornado, although the only reason for that is that momoko depends on it
  - Asynchronous, cause it is asynchronous. Not too much though, just the database stuff.

Adding support for other databases (that don't depend on tornado) should not be too difficult.
