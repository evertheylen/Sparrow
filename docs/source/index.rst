   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Sparrow's documentation!

Sparrow stands for "Single Page Application Real-time Relational Object Wrapper".

It doesn't have to be used for a SPA, but it has JSON support out of the box to send objects inside messages (I personally prefer websockets).

I could have added an extra 'a' somewhere to signal it is asynchronous.
